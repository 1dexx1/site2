## development

need to program something, even though the gml lang is not that easy, but for someone who knows lua, it's easy. development is going neither fast nor slow, nelsoni is doing something, but due to burnout, it's not easy for him...

upd: coding is finished, only the 3rd lap (as he said) and the graphical component are left

## sprites

the work is going great, I would say awesome! here is an example of one of his works = https://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.e-z.tools/dexx/3le86264fotvzij7y4.jpg

well, this is cool))

## obstacle

i think my friend is doing a pretty good job! god bless him with success and health
